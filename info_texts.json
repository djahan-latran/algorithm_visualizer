This process continues until no more swaps are needed, meaning the list is fully sorted.With each pass, the largest value 'bubbles up' to its correct position on the right.The algorithm then repeats for the remaining unsorted elements until the entire list is ordered. Due to its inefficient time complexity of <b>O(n²)</b>, Bubble Sort is primarily used for educational purposes rather than practical applications.</font>"
