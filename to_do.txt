- Scrollable area of scroll container should adjust to total height of all buttons
- Algorithm class that init's the basic parameter like self.nums, self.value_info etc and passes those to
  more specific algorithm classe e.g. BubbleSort, SelectionSort etc.
- [x] size slider 
- [x] binary search 
- linear and binary search need value to be found displayed
- [x] implement breadth-first-search
- implement depth-first-search
- finish the ui-template

BUGS

- General
  - [x] if you play an algorithm and you press pause and then switch to another algorithm 
    and press play again, the algorithm continues from previous state instead of starting all over
    with the new values
  - while holding the slider button the values change very quickly and continuously -> set interval for gui update (like for animation update)
  - bar graphs don't take up the whole surface screen at certain sizes in width
  - size slider position when selecting an algorithm and after resetting it

- Binary search
  - sometimes no green value at the end
  - sometimes "self.value_info["neutral"] = [nums[mid]]" -> list index out of range

- Pathfinding
  - speed is same as set speed in bar graph visualizations -> add speed slider

- BFS
  - not finding the 'value' -> check coordinate and value
