- Scrollable area of scroll container should adjust to total height of all buttons
- Algorithm class that init's the basic parameter like self.nums, self.value_info etc and passes those to
  more specific algorithm classe e.g. BubbleSort, SelectionSort etc.
- size slider DONE
- binary search DONE
- linear and binary search need value to be found displayed
- implement breadth-first-search

BUGS

- General
  - if you play an algorithm and you press pause and then switch to another algorithm 
    and press play again, the algorithm continues from previous state instead of starting all over
    with the new values FIXED

- Binary search
  - sometimes no green value at the end
  - sometimes "self.value_info["neutral"] = [nums[mid]]" -> list index out of range
