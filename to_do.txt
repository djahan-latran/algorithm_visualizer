- implement the algorithms as generators when they run so every step where 
  the bar graphs have to be redrawn it yields to the game loop inside the GuiManager
  and blits the current surface states
- the visualizer should have an attribute (dictionary) that the algorithm takes as a parameter and where
  the algorithm stores the state of certain values as the color that it should represent 
  before each yield (e.g. sorted values go into
  "green" and selected values go into "lightgrey")
-  1. First create "bubble sort" button on the left main menu.
   2. Clicking it should trigger a stillframe with an unsorted array displayed as bar graphs
   3. Implement a Play-Button on the right that starts the Algorithm and Animation
   4. Animation should be updated with each yield
