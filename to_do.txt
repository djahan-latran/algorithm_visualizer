TASKS

1. [x] Info Panel  
2. [x] Code Panel   
3. [x] Pathfinding Algorithm (Dijstra or A*)  2
4. Merge Sort / Quick Sort Visualization  2
5. [x] write comments on code in code panel
6. [x] refactor AnimationPanel update method
7. [x] when play pressed -> obstacle selection phase False
8. have instruction in info panel AND OR button selection to indicate what to do
9. error handling
10. comment and clean all the code
11. tests
12. [x] make button text white when clicked/hover over
13. [x] implement dijkstra text and code text
14. put everything in folders

- [x] REFACTOR !!!
- algorithm class that init's the basic parameter like self.nums, self.value_info etc and passes those to
  more specific algorithm classe e.g. BubbleSort, SelectionSort etc.
- [x] linear and binary search need value to be found displayed
- make menu panel size parametric -> height adjusts to button amounts but buttons get created in a LOOP

BUGS/FIXES

- General
  - when changing list size for bar graph visualizations 
    bar graph width doesn't adjust to surface size properly

- Binary search
  - [x] sometimes no green value at the end
  - [x] sometimes "self.value_info["neutral"] = [nums[mid]]" -> list index out of range

- InfoPanel
  - [x] text window not showing all the text

- CodePanel
  - Scrollbar duplicates whenever another algorithm is selected

- Algorithm
  - Dijkstra
    - [x] when algorithm doesnt find the target the application crashes
